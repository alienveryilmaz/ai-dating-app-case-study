## 🧠 What is TwoCAN?

**TwoCAN** is an AI-powered mobile dating application designed to create **genuinely compatible relationships**, not superficial matches.

Unlike traditional dating apps that rely on photos, interests, or shallow preferences, TwoCAN is built on a **scientifically grounded temperament framework** and a **deeply personalized AI system**.

Before entering the app, users are required to complete a **scientific temperament & personality assessment**.  
Only after this step can they access the platform and start matching with others who are **truly compatible at a behavioral and character level**.

## 🔬 Scientific Foundation — 9 Types of Temperament

At the core of TwoCAN lies the **Nine Types of Temperament Model** (9 Tip Mizaç Modeli):

- A scientifically based temperament & character model
- Focused on **core motivations, emotional patterns, and behavioral tendencies**
- Designed to go far beyond surface-level preferences

This model forms the backbone of:
- User profiling
- Compatibility scoring
- AI reasoning & personalization

---

## 🧮 Compatibility & Matching System

TwoCAN uses a **custom-built, complex compatibility algorithm** that:

- Is fully based on temperament & personality data
- Goes beyond binary matches or simple percentages
- Produces **deep compatibility insights**, not just “matches”

The goal is not quantity — but **long-term relational quality**.

---

## 🤖 AI Architecture Overview

TwoCAN includes **multiple AI systems**, designed and engineered as a coherent ecosystem.

### AI Capabilities
- **Fine-tuned LLMs** specialized for temperament & relationship guidance
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** for structured knowledge injection
- **Custom AI workflows** for multi-step reasoning and scenario handling
- A dedicated **Dispatcher AI** that decides:
  - Which workflow to trigger
  - Which AI behavior or reasoning path to activate
- A primary conversational AI model that adapts dynamically based on dispatcher decisions

### Data Quality
- All AI training and knowledge data is:
  - **Manually prepared**
  - Based on **academic and scientific work**
  - Created by a professional team
- ❌ No scraped internet data  
- ❌ No automatically generated datasets  
- ✅ Fully original, domain-specific knowledge

---

## 💬 Personalized AI Relationship Assistant

TwoCAN includes a **deeply personalized AI companion** that:

- Communicates uniquely with each user
- Adapts tone, guidance, and responses based on temperament
- Remembers **conversation history**
- Remembers **important emotional moments** shared by the user
- Evolves with the user over time

This AI is not a chatbot — it acts as a **relationship guide and companion**, tailored entirely to the individual.
